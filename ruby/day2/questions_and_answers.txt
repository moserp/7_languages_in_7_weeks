f = File.open("name_of_file")
# do stuff with file
f.close

File.open("name_of_file") do |f|
  # do stuff with file
end

using a block the file is automatically closed


Hash to Array:
foo = {:a => :b, :c => :d}
foo.to_a
 => [[:a, :b], [:c, :d]]

 ie use #to_a, which converts the hash to an array of arrays, where the child
 arrays are the key/value pairs from the hash

Array to Hash:

bar = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Hash[*bar]
 => { 1 => 2, 3 => 4}

 ie each pair of value in the array become a kay/value pair in the hash. You
 must have an even number of elements in the array


You can iterate through a Hash as it include Enumerable


Arrays as: stacks, lists,
